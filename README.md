# Waypoint Autonomous Guided Vehicle with GPS
The project implements a GPS-guided autonomous vehicle capable of navigating to predefined waypoints (like “home” or “store”) using real-time GPS and compass data. Built around the **ESP8266**, the system processes GPS coordinates and compares them with target waypoints to control motion via **L298N motor driver**, enabling autonomous point-to-point navigation without manual intervention.
